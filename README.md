A JavaScript dialect for IDPF EPUB3 OPF/OCF and the Open Publication Distribution System OPDS 

	This document is a purposed structure for JS based EPUB
	It is created and maintained by Lars C Wallin (@larscwallin)

	My work is based on examples from:

	* https://code.google.com/p/epub-samples/ 
	* The Blank Book package (http://jasonhibbs.co.uk/2012/blank-book/) by Jason Mervyn Hibbs 
	* The spec on http://opds-spec.org/
	
	As you will notice the code is somewhere between documentation and implementation and kinda sketchy.  
	It is well commented however so anyone who is into EPUB should grasp things fairly easily I hope.
	
	Please, do fork, send suggestions and whatnot! :)
